An arknights-themed new tab page for Chromium-based browsers. 

A few years back, I found an arknights new tab page on github that displayed news and banners from the official website, and it was really good. Unfortunately, it disappeared off github, and the extension that I downloaded stopped pulling data. Because very few arknights new tab pages exist, I tried to fix it up...

*To install:*

1. Download `primitive_RI_terminal_service(v3.2.1)` from this github page.
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions
3. Make sure you have `Developer Mode` enabled in the top right hand corner.
4. Load unpacked > Select the `primitive_RI_terminal_service(v3.2.1)` folder.

*Currently, this features:*

News of upcoming, current, and past events from the Arknights Wiki.

A clock (with seconds) at the bottom right hand corner.

Google Gemini at the top right hand corner (the little white rhombus).
- To enable this, you need to have a [working API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) (free works.)
- Try prompting the AI at the top right corner. If you don't have an API, it will prompt you. Copy and paste the API, and it should work.

Current Weather/Temperature.
